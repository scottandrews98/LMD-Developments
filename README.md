# LMD-Developments
This site was a redevelopment for http://www.lmddevelopments.co.uk. Their old site was not responsive and did not diaplay the total number of houses on display well. This has all changed in the new site. I was responsible for managing the team and for developing the backend of the site in php. Here are some images below check out the full working site at http://lmddevelopments.scottandrews27.worcestercomputing.com.
